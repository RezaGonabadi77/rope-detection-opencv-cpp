# Rope Detection and Position Sending System for Quadcopters

This project aims to detect a rope on the ground using computer vision techniques and send its position data to a quadcopter via UDP communication. The system is developed in C++ using OpenCV library for image processing.

# Features

- Rope detection using line detection algorithm
- Color detection for identifying the color of the rope
- QR code detection for additional functionalities
- UDP communication for sending position data to a quadcopter

# Requirements

- C++ compiler
- OpenCV library
- QR code detection library (if applicable)
- Quadcopter with UDP communication capability



# Installation
- OpenCV
- QR code detection library (if applicable)

Build the project using your preferred C++ compiler.

# Usage
1. Connect your camera to the system.
2. Run the executable binary.
3. The system will process the camera feed and detect the rope.
4. Position data will be sent to the quadcopter via UDP communication.
